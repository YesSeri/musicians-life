# Musicians life

This is a game about becoming a musician. You can go around town doing gigs, and you can recruit musicians to your band. 

## Gameplay

The gigs will be as following. If you don't have any fellow musicians it is only you playing. If you have more musicians in your songs there will be more instruments. There should be a very simple garage band like music editor, but limited so it is easy to make songs. The songs will get exported in four versions. 
 -  Song and guitar is required
 -  Optional bass
 -  Optional piano
 -  Optional drums
 
In the gigs you have to do a small guitar hero thing to play the music. If you fail it sounds bad. To many fails and you get no money. Different instruments have different timbre. 

Music and singing should be Transistor like, not necessarily cyberpunk, but the singing should be without words.
